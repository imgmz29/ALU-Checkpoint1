## Design Description
In this project, we built a 32-bit ALU with addition and subtraction, which are supported by CSA, MUX and logic gates. Below are the basic modules or functions of our ALU and introductions of how we realzied them.

### MUX

### CSA
We designed a 1-bit full adder and used 1-bit full adders and 2to1 MUXes to design a 2-bit CSA. Then we used 2-bit CSAs and 4to2 MUXes to design a 4-bit CSA. Just in this way, we finally built a 32-bit CSA with 16-bit CSAs and 64to32 MUXes.

### Addition and Subtraction

### Overflow
